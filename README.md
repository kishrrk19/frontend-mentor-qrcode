## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

-I learned how to use height for .container and elements. I should not use max-hight for container and it's better to fix the hight for elements.
-I should use min-height: 100vh; for container. The container automatically expands to match the height of the viewport, allowing the content to be fully displayed. 
-I should not use pixel for font-size and use rem.

### Continued development

I need to continue same kind of chalenge, using CSS.
